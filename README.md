# FileBrowser
A multi-purpose filebrowser. This is initially intended to be a [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) file browser plugin but can be easily adapted to integrate with [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/) among others.

### Demo
See [here a demo](http://rawgit.com/jonataswalker/FileBrowser/master/examples/ex1-ckeditor.html).

This is (yet) unuseful unless you want it in Portuguese (pt-BR).
